# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Personal Portfolio With Bootstrap Frame
I have build a portfolio page using Bootstrap, which you can be added too as the weeks go on.

A portfolio can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. In this portfolio i have highlighted points in my process that work well and showcases the thought and processes behind it creating a website portfolio. My portfolio will be deployed live on the web and will also be edited throughout camp to hopefull aid me in having a successful career search after the boot camp.

This challenge will set me up for future success by applying the core skills i have recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables and Bootstrap
